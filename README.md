# 0x1B - C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
